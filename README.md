The compiler works as follows.


```$ make all```

Makes the executable name compile. The compiler can then be used as ```./compile filename```.

```$ make tests```
The tests folder contains 3 test cases, 2 from Apple's book and one is a small program, to test the compiler. This command will run all the test cases, one at a time.
